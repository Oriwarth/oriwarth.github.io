      <description>I took the personality test at understandmyself.com. This is neither an endorsement nor an indictment, just a reflection of what this tests have to offer. Regardless of what you think of the author of that particular test, I like him. I sent the website a letter as feedback containing my comments about my specific results, though here I want to focus more on personality tests in general.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken personality tests in the past, good.</description>
