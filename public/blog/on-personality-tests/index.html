<p>I took the personality test at understandmyself.com. This is neither an endorsement nor an indictment, just a reflection of what this tests have to offer. Regardless of what you think of the author of that particular test, I like him. I sent the website a letter as feedback containing my comments about my specific results, though here I want to focus more on personality tests in general.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t taken personality tests in the past, good. I don&rsquo;t recommend them in general, so keep on living the rest of your life like that. I won&rsquo;t go into explaining the Big 5 Personality Scale, factor analysis or PCA (maybe for another time). The gist of the theory behind this is that: people vary in personality (obviously). Thus it follows that language can capture those differences in personality (duh). So the idea is, give an inintal population (group of people) a long set of adjectives and ask them if they identify themselves with them (this is called a self-report).</p>
<p>When you analize the results, you will find some correlations. Say, people that agree with &ldquo;I often feel happy&rdquo; are likely to agree with &ldquo;I often smile&rdquo;. Maybe so many people that agree with the first one will agree with the second one, that we can just ask one of the two without losing much information. This same method is then applied to all the questions: &ldquo;I often worry&rdquo; gets grouped with &ldquo;I often feel anxious&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like new ideas&rdquo; gets grouped with &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to listen to new music&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you repeat this process over and over, you will end up with 5 main groups, The Big 5, namely: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. Search for them in your privacy-respecting search engine of choice if you want to learn more.</p>
<p>This all sounds all well and good, except when it comes to results that evaluate you. Because subtelties emerge&hellip;</p>
<p>Context matters. When asked to rate yourself w.r.t the statement &ldquo;I am easily annoyed&rdquo;, the answer will depend greatly on context. Being easilly annoyed with friends/family is one thing vs ocassionally indulging the spirits of road rage. I think it is clear how the answer might vary depending on context. How should you answer? Using your most recent experience? You take the average of all the situations where you could&rsquo;ve been angerend in the past 2 years? The one that you identify more as? In the case of the last one, it is eveident how the personality test becomes futile if it is trying to tell you something about you don&rsquo;t already know. It will reflect back whatever you put in.</p>
<p>And sometimes it is flagrant in doing so. Suppose you disagree with the statement: &ldquo;I often worry&rdquo;. Then the results will say: &ldquo;you are a person that doesn&rsquo;t worry often&rdquo;. Yeah, right on buddy. Maybe it could be argued that the value of the test is in the introspection that occurs while doing the test. I am open to being convinced of that. Deciding whether you consider yourself to &ldquo;worry more about the future than the past&rdquo; or &ldquo;disregard the wishes of others&rdquo; might be worthwile.</p>
<p>Say you are deciding if you consider yourself to be &ldquo;easily distracted&rdquo;, then many posibilities arise: you are and you don&rsquo;t notice it, you are and you notice it, you are not but it&rsquo;s something you still want to improve on, and so on. Are you easily distracted when cooking, exercising or reading through the fine print of some goverment paperwork you have to fill out? I say that the ease of being distracted varies from situation to situation. And once again, the short-comings of these &ldquo;self-reporting&rdquo; show up again.</p>
<p>And then your results say that you are more easily distracted than 5% of the population or 90% or whatever you chose to answer. Is that truly meaningful? If you need to concentrate on a regular basis, then you should be compared among others of the same cohort. If not, the proportions of the cohorts must be known to whomever is interpreting the results. Say, older people are more conscientious than younger people. Then you need to know if the population you&rsquo;re being compared agains is mostly comprised of the young, old, a mixture, what %? Else, these results can quickly become misleading.</p>
<p>I wanted to post some of my relfections about my particular results, but I&rsquo;ll pass for now. Suffices to say that I rate this test 50% accurate. (How the turns have tabled). I would like to point out once again that maybe the most introspection I had was while doing the test, and mostly writing my feedback to the website. I hope that whoever reads it at least finds it midly entretaining. As for you, my dear reader, I hope that you found this midly entretaining as well.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
