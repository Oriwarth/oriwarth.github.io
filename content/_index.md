# Oriwarth's blog

I have some shower thoughts that I want to share and I don't want to subject anyone I know to listen to the entirety of them. Hopefully writing them down helps me concretize them and move on to the next thing. Mostly ramblings, and thoughts that come to me while reading books. And I could use practicing my writing. I try to give references when needed, but also can't be bothered sometimes. 

The logo is of the double moon problem; where you can't draw a straight line (or plane) that separates two moons. It is given as an introductory motivation to machine learning, though this problem has been solved for decades. It also kind of looks like the Yin-yang, so go ahead if you want to read something into that.
